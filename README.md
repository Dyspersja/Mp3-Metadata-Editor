After selecting a file, the information contained within its metadata is read and loaded into the editor's fields.

In case the file doesn't have metadata, the editor fields are collapsed. To input any data, users need to click the "create" button, which will initialize metadata and prepare the fields for editing.

After clicking the "create" button, fields for entering metadata will appear, along with a default image indicating the absence of an album cover, next to a button for selecting a new one.

Upon selecting a new image, it will be automatically loaded into the editor's preview.

After saving the file, the file chosen at the beggining will be rewritten with the newly created/edited metadata, and in the case of adding an album cover, the file icon in the Windows File Explorer will change to the selected image.

The data displays correctly in music players. Below is an example for the Media Player built into Windows 10.
